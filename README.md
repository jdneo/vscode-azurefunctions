# Azure Functions for Visual Studio Code (Preview)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Microsoft/vscode-azurefunctions.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Microsoft/vscode-azurefunctions) [![Release Status](https://img.shields.io/github/tag/Microsoft/vscode-azurefunctions.svg?label=prerelease&colorB=0E7FC0)](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-azurefunctions/releases)

Create, debug, manage, and deploy Azure Functions directly from VS Code. Check
out this [deployment tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/tutorials/functions-extension/getting-started)
to get started with the Azure Functions extension.

## Prerequisites

* Install your desired version of the [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local)
  * For version 2.0 (This version works cross-platform, but is still in preview and not recommended for production):
    * Install [.NET Core 2.0](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core)
    * Install the Azure Functions Core Tools:
    ```bash
    npm install -g azure-functions-core-tools@core
    ```
    > Note: When installing on Ubuntu, you may need to use `sudo`. On MacOS and Linux, you may need to include the `unsafe-perm` flag, as follows:
    ```bash
    sudo npm install -g azure-functions-core-tools@core --unsafe-perm true
    ```
  * For version 1.0 (This version is only supported on Windows):
    ```bash
    npm install -g azure-functions-core-tools
    ```
* Install the prerequisites for your desired language:
  * [JavaScript](#javascript)
  * [C#](#c)
  * [Java](#java)
> NOTE: You may change your `azureFunctions.projectLanguage` user setting to multiple other 'preview' languages not listed above. This allows you to create a project/function in that language, but we do not yet support local debugging for these languages.

## Features

* Create new Function projects
* Create new Functions from a template
* Debug Function projects locally
* Deploy to Azure Function Apps
* View, create, delete, start, stop, and restart Azure Function Apps
* JSON Intellisense for `function.json`, `host.json`, and `proxies.json`
* Debug Function App on Azure (experimental)

### Create New Project

### Debug Function App Locally

![Debug](resources/Debug.gif)

### Debug Function App on Azure (experimental)
![Remote Debug](resources/RemoteDebug.gif)
> Note: This is an experimental feature and only support `Java` Azure Function currently.

To enable the remote debug, the extension will change the configuration of the target Function App:
- The `use32BitWorkerProcess` attribute will be set to false
- The `webSocketsEnabled` attribute will be set to true

The following key-value pairs will be added into the Application Settings:
- JAVA_OPTS: `-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=127.0.0.1:8898`
- HTTP_PLATFORM_DEBUG_PORT: `8898`

### Deploy to Azure

## Language-Specific Prerequisites

### JavaScript

* [Node 8.0+](https://nodejs.org/)

### C#

* [VS Code Debugger for C#](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.csharp)
* [.NET CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/?tabs=netcore2x)
* .NET Templates for Azure Functions
  * You will be automatically prompted to install these templates when you first create a project/function
    * If you are using v2.0 of the Azure Functions runtime, you must install the beta (.NET Core) templates
    * If you are using v1.0 of the Azure Functions runtime, you must install the v1.0 (.NET Framework) templates.
    > NOTE: The VS Code Debugger for C# [only supports](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/1716) attaching to 64-bit processes. v1.0 of the Azure Functions runtime defaults to 32-bit and you must install a 64-bit version. See [here](https://aka.ms/azFunc64bit) for instructions.
  * You may uninstall or reinstall the templates with the following steps:
    1. Open Command Palette (View -> Command Palette...)
    1. Search for "Azure Functions" and "install" or "uninstall"
    1. Run the corresponding command for .NET templates

> NOTE: The default experience for C# uses class libraries (&ast;.cs files), which provide superior performance, scalability, and versatility over C# Scripts (&ast;.csx files). If you want to use C# Scripts, you may change your `azureFunctions.projectLanguage` user setting to `C#Script`.

### Java

* [VS Code Debugger for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-debug)
* [JDK 1.8+](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
* [Maven 3.0+](https://maven.apache.org/)
  > NOTE: Once Maven is downloaded, you must ensure that Maven is in your PATH environment variable. You can check this by running: `mvn -v`.
